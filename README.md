# 🧠 My C# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to the **.NET dojo** where I tackle LeetCode problems exclusively in **C#** —  
because if you can’t `new` it, `var` it, and `using` it… is it even code?

## 🚀 What's Inside
- **C# Solutions** for problems ranging from *"ah, that was nice"* to *"send help"*.
- A sprinkle of `LINQ` magic that makes me feel like a wizard.
- Comments that alternate between *"explains logic"* and *"existential crisis"*.

## 🛠 How It's Organized
- `Easy/` → Problems that make me feel smarter than I actually am.
- `Medium/` → Where I spend 80% of my time.
- `Hard/` → Where `IEnumerable` becomes `IRegretEverything`.

## 📜 Disclaimer
- Not the fastest solutions in the West, but they pass LeetCode’s judgment.
- May contain excessive `Console.WriteLine` debugging that I forgot to remove.
- All code is 100% C#, 0% Java — because I like my semicolons **just enough**.

## 🤝 Contributing
PRs are welcome… as long as they're C#.  
If you send Python, I will `throw new Exception("InvalidLanguageException");`.

## 📅 Motivation Tracker
- **Day 1:** This is fun!
- **Day 10:** My `List<int>` is now my best friend.
- **Day 25:** I accidentally solved a problem in O(∞) time.
